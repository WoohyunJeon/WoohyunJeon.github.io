            <h2>Eötvös Number Analysis - Surface Hydrophobicity Estimation</h2>
            <p>This project aimed to automate diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification from retinal scan images using a transfer learning pipeline. The team implemented a convolutional neural network 
                (CNN) based on VGG16, paired with a custom multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, to categorize retinal images into five disease stages (0-4).
            </p>        
        
            <p>I contributed to architecture selection, dataset curation, and model optimization. I co-led the integration of a high-resolution preprocessing pipeline using contrast normalization, 
                Gaussian blurring, and adaptive cropping. To address class imbalance, we applied undersampling and targeted augmentation (rotation and flipping), generating a balanced dataset of 
                6000 images per class. I also upgraded my local machine to support GPU-accelerated training.
            </p>

            <p> Model improvement focused on hyperparameter tuning, where I shifted from heuristic to systematic optimization, adjusting learning rates, dropout ratios, and normalization layers. 
                I helped implement a Random Forest baseline for benchmarking and evaluated model performance using internal and external test sets. Final testing accuracy reached 60%, with 
                stronger classification in late-stage DR classes. Feature map visualizations confirmed that the CNN captured increasingly abstract vascular structures through its convolutional layers.

            <h2>Eötvös Number Analysis - Surface Hydrophobicity Estimation</h2>
            <p>This project focused on quantifying surface hydrophobicity by analyzing the shape and behavior of a droplet resting on a substrate. Using experimental data extracted from 
                droplet profile images, I implemented a MATLAB pipeline for polynomial regression (orders 2-8), numerical differentiation, and integration. A total of 22 data points were 
                processed using least-squares fitting, and curve accuracy was evaluated using the R² coefficient.
            </p>        
        
            <p>Higher-order polynomials (6th and 8th) yielded contact angles exceeding 150°, confirming superhydrophobic behavior. The fitted curves were integrated using the trapezoidal 
                rule to estimate droplet volume, which was then used to calculate the Eötvös number (Eo ≈ 1.96). This indicated that surface tension forces dominated over gravity, consistent 
                with the droplet's near-spherical shape.
            </p>

            <p> While higher-order fits improved curvature accuracy, they also introduced overfitting near the data boundaries. I validated the pipeline's consistency by comparing results 
                across polynomial orders and analyzing fit sensitivity. The full process enabled accurate, repeatable estimates of both contact angle and volume based solely on image-derived geometry.

            <h2>UT Vulcan</h2>
            <p>Vulcan is a quadcopter reconnaissance drone designed for the 2025 AEAC competition. Its primary objective was to locate and map fire hotspots using infrared detection while 
                maintaining autonomy and flight stability. The design prioritized simplicity, maneuverability, and rapid data acquisition, using a lightweight airframe to enable speeds 
                up to 15 m/s and a range of approximately 13 km.
            </p>        
        
            <p>
                The airframe features a hybrid-frame layout with a carbon fiber mainplate stack and reinforced cross-bracing for torsional stiffness. An onboard NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano ran 
                a custom computer vision stack using YOLOv8 and a 160° FOV infrared sensor to detect and localize fire signatures in real time. Localization data was fused with drone 
                telemetry using an Extended Kalman Filter to continuously generate georeferenced KML files for mission mapping.
            </p>

            <p> I led the mechanical design and manufacturing of Vulcan's airframe, focusing on structural stiffness, low weight, and ease of integration for avionics and propulsion 
                components. This included designing the cross-braced frame layout, selecting composite materials, fabricating custom mounts, and assembling the complete airframe. I 
                collaborated closely with the software and electrical teams to ensure accessibility, EMI shielding, and structural robustness throughout testing.

            <h2>UT Atlas</h2>
            <p>Atlas is a hybrid VTOL UAV developed as a subscale prototype for urban air mobility systems in the 2024 AEAC competition. The vehicle featured a quadcopter-fixed-wing 
                configuration, designed to autonomously transport a simulated four-passenger payload, execute precision landings in constrained environments, and demonstrate 
                long-range cruise performance with a predicted range of up to 48 km.
            </p>        
        
            <p>The airframe used a twin-boom low-wing layout with a composite-reinforced fuselage and modular booms supporting both the vertical lift rotors and tail surfaces. A 
                single rear-mounted pusher motor enabled efficient fixed-wing cruise. Custom CFRP box spars and GFRP-clad foam wings ensured sufficient stiffness for high-speed forward 
                flight and multirotor yaw stability. A full autonomy stack was implemented using a Jetson Nano and Luxonis OAK-D S2 stereo camera, supported by simulation-driven PID 
                tuning and pose estimation via YOLOv8-based computer vision.
            </p>    
            
            <p>I conducted aerodynamic analysis, cruise and hover performance modeling, and PID tuning in Gazebo simulation. I contributed to the estimation of stall 
                speed and optimal cruise velocity, evaluated fixed-wing stability through simulation, and supported transition tuning between multirotor and fixed-wing flight. I also 
                developed flight test procedures to validate transition stability and hover control under varying payload conditions.

            <h2>UT Cyclone</h2>
            <p>UT Cyclone is a heavy-lift hexacopter platform developed over multiple years by the UTAT UAS division, evolving into a versatile aerial vehicle for both passenger transport 
                nd autonomous payload delivery. The drone features a spiral-frame configuration that supports modular composite arms, robust lifting capability, and precise control — enabling 
                it to perform across diverse AEAC competition roles from drone taxiing to water firefighting missions.
            </p>        
        
            <p> Originally adapted in 2024 as a fallback for the Atlas VTOL concept, Cyclone was configured to carry a 2 kg passenger payload over a 13 km range, achieving a total system mass of 
                14 kg. In this role, it prioritized mechanical reliability, ease of repair, and autonomous waypoint navigation. The team scored 1st in the on-site technical presentation, and 
                post-flight, the airframe was restored using prepreg carbon fiber components and hot-swappable spares developed in-house.
            </p>    

            <p>In 2025, Cyclone III was redesigned for aerial firefighting and optimized for performance under heavy load. It featured shortened arms for increased torsional stiffness, a retractable 
                2.5 L water delivery payload, and a custom plug-based intake mechanism. Enhanced onboard autonomy, powered by a Jetson Orin and computer vision tracking using YOLOv8, enabled accurate 
                target tank localization and smooth water release. Cyclone's mature platform made it the team's most reliable system for extended autonomous missions.

            <h2>PID Tuning Stand</h2>
            <p>The PID tuning stand is a single-axis stabilization platform developed to safely test and fine-tune the PID parameters of multirotor drone designs. It allows for 
                precise control tuning without risking damage to the airframe during early-stage flight testing.
            </p>

            <p>I initially explored gyroscopic stabilization methods but ultimately proposed a simpler single-axis design, leveraging the inherent symmetry of most copter-style 
                drones. This approach streamlined the setup and reduced mechanical complexity while maintaining effective tuning capability.
            </p>   
            
            <p>By implementing this system, the team significantly reduced the risk of crash-induced failures during tuning, lowering the need for replacement parts and helping 
                to conserve the budget across multiple test campaigns.
